# Code Walkthrough

XInput is a Windows application that allows you to use Xbox controllers. It can read button presses, thumbstick movements, and make the controllers vibrate. The application uses a library called **XInput** to communicate with the controllers.

### Imports and DLL Function Declarations

At the beginning of the ```Form1.vb``` file, we import necessary libraries and declare functions from the XInput DLL.

``` vbnet
Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices

<DllImport("XInput1_4.dll")>
Private Shared Function XInputGetState(dwUserIndex As Integer, ByRef pState As XINPUT_STATE) As Integer
End Function
```

**Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices:** This line allows us to use features that let managed code (like our VB.NET code) interact with unmanaged code (like the XInput DLL).

**DllImport:** This attribute tells the program that we want to use a function from an external library (the XInput DLL) to get the state of the Xbox controller.



### Defining Structures

Next, we define structures that represent the controller's state and input.

``` vbnet
<StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)>
Public Structure XINPUT_STATE
    <FieldOffset(0)>
    Public dwPacketNumber As UInteger
    <FieldOffset(4)>
    Public Gamepad As XINPUT_GAMEPAD
End Structure
```
**StructLayout:** This attribute specifies how the fields of the structure are laid out in memory.

**XINPUT_STATE:** This structure holds the state of the controller, including a packet number (used to track changes) and the gamepad data.

``` vbnet
<StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)>
Public Structure XINPUT_GAMEPAD
    Public wButtons As UShort
    Public bLeftTrigger As Byte
    Public bRightTrigger As Byte
    Public sThumbLX As Short
    Public sThumbLY As Short
    Public sThumbRX As Short
    Public sThumbRY As Short
End Structure
```

**XINPUT_GAMEPAD:** This structure contains information about the buttons pressed and the positions of the thumbsticks and triggers.


### Initializing the Application


When the form loads, we initialize the application.

``` vbnet
Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
    InitializeApp()
End Sub
```

**Form1_Load:** This is an event handler that runs when the form is loaded. It calls the ```InitializeApp()``` method, which sets up the application.


### Timer for Polling Controller State
A timer is set to check the controller state every 15 milliseconds.

``` vbnet
Private Sub InitializeTimer1()
    Timer1.Interval = 15 ' Set the timer to tick every 15 milliseconds
    Timer1.Start()       ' Start the timer
End Sub
```

**Timer1.Interval:** This sets how often the timer will trigger (every 15 milliseconds).

**Timer1.Start():** This starts the timer, which will call the ```Timer1_Tick``` method repeatedly.

### Updating Controller Data

In the timer's tick event, we update the controller data.

``` vbnet
Private Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick
    UpdateControllerData()
End Sub
```

**UpdateControllerData():** This method checks the state of the controllers and updates the UI accordingly.

### Getting Controller State

Inside ```UpdateControllerData```, we retrieve the current state of each connected controller.

``` vbnet
For controllerNumber As Integer = 0 To 3
    Connected(controllerNumber) = IsControllerConnected(controllerNumber)
    If Connected(controllerNumber) Then
        UpdateControllerState(controllerNumber)
    End If
Next
```

**For loop:** This loop checks up to four controllers (0 to 3).

**IsControllerConnected(controllerNumber):** This function checks if a controller is connected and returns true or false.

**UpdateControllerState(controllerNumber):** If the controller is connected, this method retrieves its current state.


### Updating Button States



When we retrieve the controller state, we check which buttons are pressed.

``` vbnet
Private Sub UpdateButtonPosition(CID As Integer)
    DPadUpPressed = (ControllerPosition.Gamepad.wButtons And DPadUp) <> 0
    ' Similar checks for other buttons...
End Sub
```

**wButtons:** This field contains the state of all buttons as a number.

**Bitwise AND operator (```And```):** This checks if a specific button is pressed by comparing it to a constant (like ```DPadUp```).

### Vibration Control


To control the vibration of the controller, we have buttons in the UI.

``` vbnet
Private Sub ButtonVibrateLeft_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles ButtonVibrateLeft.Click
    VibrateLeft(NumControllerToVib.Value, TrackBarSpeed.Value)
End Sub
```

**ButtonVibrateLeft_Click:** This event runs when the "Vibrate Left" button is clicked.

**VibrateLeft():** This method triggers vibration on the specified controller with the desired intensity.




This application provides a hands-on way to interact with Xbox controllers using VB.NET. By understanding each section of the code, you can see how the application retrieves controller states, manages input, and provides feedback through vibration.
